Dorel Juvenile offers all digital platforms in the form of services (service platform). By creating adaptable services for each platform the whole organisation is able to rapidly create new services which can be used whenever suitable.

## One for all, all for one

The upside of custom made solution that one can be _pixel precise_ about the end result. The downside of this is that it is hard to maintain overall quality and maintain timelines. This is the reason that we currently see the rise of the Platform as a Service model. A service platform which can be tweaked by setting certain variables allows you to have one platform which you can maintain, scale and optimise versus multiple small platforms.

Dorel.io moves towards the service platform model to serve internal customers as quickly as possible. We have single purpose platforms and frameworks which we can adapt to suit the user's needs and where we can maintain a high standard in the mean time.

## Adaptable services platforms (zero-to-one)

Adaptable service platforms are not fixed platforms, but platforms that allow you to set a few variables to customise the service to your needs.

An example of this is the [Content Management System Platform ](#) Dorel Juvenile uses. With the entrance of a few variables (URL, the name of the website and admin email) Dorel Juvenile is able to create globally accessible CMS systems within minutes.

Zero-to-One refers to the possibility that, it might be hard to get to the service and have a first user signup, but that the second, tenth, hundredth or millionth user is a click of a button away. Platforms like Facebook, Amazon AWS and Google are good examples of this principle.

## Platform services versus Frameworks

Services are not necessarily frameworks and vice versa. Dorel Juvenile uses many frameworks like a design framework to generate branded website elements. A framework as such does not comply with the [platform definition](/service-manual/vision/platforms-and-ecosystems.html) because it is not used as such.

In most cases, a framework is part of a platform and something you might not directly interact with.
