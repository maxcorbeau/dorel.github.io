This creative brief will be created for every page. This helps answering the following questions: What is the reason of existence for that page? When is the goal met, how is it successful? What would a user expect to find on this page? This approach will also make it easier to define if the visual design is effective or not.


**A. Objective: What is the goal of the page?**


Why is this page necessary? What do you want people to get out of this. Is it purely a page that provides information?


**B. Focus: What is the most important thing to say or show?**


Identify the single most important motivation for this page. If this can’t be explained in one sentence, the idea is probably too cluttered.


**C. Context: How does this relate to the strategy**


Are you aware of similar activity somewhere within the brand? How do competitors do this?
Does this page influence the user path a user takes to perform a certain task? 


**D. Ownership:**


Name the owner of the page. Name the editor of the page who will edit the page. This is also for future reference. 


**E. Content:**


|---|---|
|**URL**|_Does the URL of the page look logical in the structure of where the page should live? Also look at point C Context for a fit._|
|**Page description**|_Serves as advertising copy. Should be approximately 150-160 characters._|
|**Keywords**|_Define the keywords for the page._|
|**Titles (h1, h2, h3)**| _Make a overview of the titles of the page. This will provide as a umbrella for the content you’d like to show on the page._|
|**Content**|_Do not use jargon or words that internal stakeholders use, but words the target audience can relate to._|
|**Track**|_Which elements should be tracked on the page? KPI: How will you evaluate it’s effectiveness?_|
