To create Frontend Design as a Service, Dorel Juvenile uses [Google Polymer](http://polymer-project.org).
With Polymer elements, you can assemble websites like lego blocks. All elements are created for a certain purpose, like: "input fields", "sliders", "headers", etcetera.
This methodology creates a design system with a five step hierarchy. Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages.

> By creating these elements in a structured way we can automate the process of creating new branded elements and websites.
