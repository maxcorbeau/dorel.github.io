## Single source: 
Working on different repositories is a waste of resources, includes duplications and inconsistencies. 
The digital design guide (kitchensink, component library, etc.) on Dorel.IO is leading and will be the central source for design guidelines. This allows for the bundling the resources making it:

> “It’s about better, faster, and shared services.”
>
> -- <cite>Henk Jan Gerzee</cite>

(source: from [Digital Culture](/service-manual/vision/digital-culture.html))
Additions are then directly in the main source (Dorel.IO framework) and is then by definition globally available.

## Design with purpose: 
Designing without purpose is decoration. This usually clutters information.
So design a visual enhancement to serve a purpose, not just decorational. What issue are you trying to solve, what message are you communicating?
This can be done for a page by for instance using the [Creative Brief](/service-manual/global-design-framework/creative-brief.html) to define the purpose of a page. Then all the designing that’s done on the page can be related to see if it meets the goals.

## Make design global/scalable: 
The brands for Dorel Juvenile are global. Inconsistent design for a userpath across websites is disruptive. The collective costs of designing and maintaining all these designs is significant.  Local resources are better spent on creating local content. 
Every design element should fit in the global master brand. A global template which allows for global consistency allowing room for local content and promotions is key.
If you’ve implemented something on a specific location, think on forehand about possibilities of how it could be used in other locations as well. And how it could potentially affect other elements. The [Kitchen Sink](http://localhost:4000/service-manual/help-people-to-use-your-service/kitchensink-of-all-elements.html) is an ideal tool to validate how design elements relate to one another.

## Make design consistent: 
The framework is based on global design pattern definitions. 
Always add this change first in the ‘Kitchen Sink’ to see the similarities and coherence of the addition. This way you will immediately validate if the change makes sense in the overall design. Additional benefit is that you would see the nomenclature of the already existing elements. 

## Make content design scannable: 
This goes both for visual designers as for content editors, make the design scannable. Website users have a short attention span (approx 2 seconds per page) and will scan through a page to see if it’s a relevant page for their goal. 
Focus on the content, and for instance use important keywords in the titles so a user can relate. In that same way the design of the page should always be content first, design is a tool to utilize the contents potential.

## Mobile first: 
Mobile is intertwined with how users gather information from our websites. Having a mobile first approach focusses on the most important information, and then build onwards from that. Enhance the experience once the screen size grows. Always refer back to the [Creative Brief](http://localhost:4000/service-manual/global-design-framework/creative-brief.html) created for that page, to see if the content you want to place or design you’d like to create still fits the purpose of the page.
