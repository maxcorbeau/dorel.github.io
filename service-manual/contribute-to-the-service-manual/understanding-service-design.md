    <h2>How we design services</h2>

    <p>At Dorel, we believe in two credos. First, all services are <i>digital by default</i>, this might be the app a team creates for our customers, the website you use for marketing activities or the software that controls the robots in our factories. This is the reason why we look at everything from a digital perspective.<br>
    Secondly, we believe that <i>everybody is a designer</i>. This means that everybody within Dorel is welcome to contribute to the service design manual for a topic in her or his expertise. You can read how to write a contribution <a href="/service-manual/contribute-to-the-service-manual/work-on-the-service-manual.html" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
