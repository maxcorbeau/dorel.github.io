At Dorel Juvenile, we believe in two credos. First, all services are _digital by default_, this might be the app a team creates for our customers, the website you use for marketing activities or the software that controls the robots in our factories. This is the reason why we look at everything from a digital perspective.
Secondly, we believe that _everybody is a designer_. This means that everybody within Dorel Juvenile is welcome to contribute to the service design manual for a topic in her or his expertise. You can read how to write a contribution [here](/service-manual/contribute-to-the-service-manual/work-on-the-service-manual.html.

If you want to work on your own service design manual, you can take a look at ours on [Github](https://github.com/dorel/dorel.github.io). Or we would like to advice you to take a look at the service design manual of the [UK government](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), which was a huge inspiration for us.
