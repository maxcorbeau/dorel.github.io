Every employee of Dorel or every freelancer or agency that works for Dorel is welcome to contribute to the service design manual. In this manual we explain _how Dorel creates services for its customers_. Customers can be people who buy Dorel products, but also internal customers, like a marketing team that uses a digital service.

## How to write an article for the Service Manual?

First of all, great that you want to contribute!

There are two main ways to contribute:

1. Extend or edit an existing page.
2. Create a new page.

You are welcome to do both. On Github (see: "How can you contribute?") you can see who the original contributors are of the page. You can get in touch with them to discuss your viewpoints and explain how you want to extend their article. When an article is new, you have more freedom to use the greenfield.

### Important to bear in mind

*Always try to write in a way that others can understand your work too.*  
Sometimes this is hard because of the nature of your article. But we find it important that everybody is able to read and understand de design manual. You can use services like the [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to create proper, readable texts.

*Always write from the user's perspective*  
Write an article from the perspective of the user, how will they use your service / framework or the service / framework you are writing the article about.

*Always write from the group perspective (use "we")*  
If possible, use the form of "we". This makes the Service Design Guide a whole and a collective piece of work.

*Use other people's work? No problem, but always mention the source*

*Work with your peers*  
You can find what others have been writing and -if possible- connect your contribution to theirs. This is why we highly recommend using links in your articles to reference other pages in this manual.

## How can you contribute?

Our service manual is on [Github](https://github.com/dorel/dorel.github.io) and we use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to write articles. We highly recommend contributing directly on Github.

## What is Service Design?

Service design is a form of conceptual design that involves the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers. Service design may function as a way to inform changes to an existing service or create a new service entirely. The purpose of service design methodologies is to establish best practices for designing services according to both the needs of customers and the competencies and capabilities of service providers.
