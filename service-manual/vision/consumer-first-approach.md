> Technology is Dorel’s new grain. Technology allows the creation of superior consumer experiences. And these experiences are digital today. 

Consumers first means digital first. Our consumers are online and are digital natives. That is why we design our services digital first. And building great services means meeting and exceeding consumer expectations. We do so by building a digital ecosystem. A flexible network of platforms, API connected, leveraging cloud infrastructure to allow better and faster shared services for our consumers.  This allows us to constantly and effectively adapt our ecosystem to our consumers needs.

To ensure high quality services, in line with the Dorel standards, we are incrementally shaping a service design manual, helping our digital technology team to make services so good, that people will prefer to use them. This manual describes the way we work, the way we develop, and the way we release. I belief in global collaboration. Not only within the Dorel organization, though also with talented people across the global outside Dorel. The ambition to “care for precious life” should unite us. This manual will allow improved collaboration within and also with partners outside the Dorel organization.
