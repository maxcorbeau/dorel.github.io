Dorel's holistic vision for digital services revolves around a global platform strategy which is divided into three sections. Every section follows up a section after an undefined period of time. The time axis is not intended to be used after a period of time, but rather to when the next horizon becomes the first operational one.

## Horizon One: Platforms and Ecosystems

All services Dorel builds are created as platforms (click [here](./platforms-and-ecosystems) to learn more about the platform and ecosystem definitions Dorel uses). Those platforms enable others to create new services and platforms on top of them. Because all platforms are separated from each other, [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) start to emerge. Services, that are independently deployable and can be used in any way of form thinkable.

## Horizon Two: Digital Services and other Business Builders

The overarching theme of this vision are the digital services, these services can be used by any brand at any time. All services have high standards and high Key Performance Indicators. Services are global and available for everybody who needs to use them. Other is a name and an email address enough to spin-up complete services with back and front ends.

The most important benefit of services is the fact that one service can be managed and improved rather than multiple single ones. Instead of a custom solution, users of the services will use identical services that can be filled with custom content, products, etcetera.

Metaphorically, Facebook is a good example. A name and an email are enough to get access to the vast amount of services Facebook offers. This does not mean that the Facebook platform is the same for all users. Everybody sees different content and is able to adjust the service to her needs. Facebook itself focusses on improving only this one platform. Facebook is [an example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Platform) of a platform.

## Horizon Three: Visionaries

Visionaries look at the future, what do the platforms and services enable Dorel to do further down the road?

To map out all these visionaries, Dorel uses certain design methods and principles to streamline research. To read more about these methods click [here](./design-frameworks)
