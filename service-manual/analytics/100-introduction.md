This section of the manual describes the Analytics part of the Dorel Digital Ecosystem. The objective is to deliver Analytics as a Service (AaaS) so that business units can gather insights about applications and their users without the need to implement analytics themselves. This process will be done in phases:

 1. **Phase 1 - MVP ('17Q1)**:  deploy analytics for the new Dorel.io framework, providing similar level of reporting and the ability to scale.
 2. **Phase 2 - Extension (TBD)**: provide additional analytics capabilities (e.g. advanced segmentation & reporting, predictive analytics).
